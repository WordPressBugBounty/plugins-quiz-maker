The Quiz Maker plugin itself does not have the functionality for adding math equations into questions. For adding %s math equations %s into the %s Quiz Maker plugin %s you can make use of several math equation plugins such as %s MathJax - LaTex plugin. %s For adding the math equations just install and activate the mentioned plugin. It is one of the easiest math plugins. With the help of it, you can add as many equations as you need, even if they include several symbols. In this %s demo, %s you can see a step-by-step tutorial on how to use MathJax. You have to be careful to use less-than signs, ampersands, and other HTML special characters within your math equations. %s For example, to add a squared symbol, you need to write down the following sign ^2. (do not forget to insert $ character to mark the beginning and ending)."
